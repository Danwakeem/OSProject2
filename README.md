# OS Project 2

> I am going to start and hopefully finish the code by this weekend so we can use the weekend to write the paper. The program looks pretty easy from the description so it shouldn't be too bad. If you would like to help with the program just let me know what part you are going to work on.

### What is Dan doing?
* ~~Part 1 of the project~~

### How to compile?
> g++ *.cpp -o name -lrt use this only if we need to measure time with real cycles and not just the simulated clock cycles.
